# üß† Comparative Sentiment Analysis: Classical ML vs LSTM

This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using both classical machine learning models and a deep learning model (LSTM). The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative and compare the performance of traditional approaches vs neural networks.

## üìÅ Project Overview

**Objective**:  
Predict sentiment polarity of movie reviews using:
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network)

**Dataset**:  
IMDb Dataset (preprocessed CSV)  
- 50,000 labeled reviews (balanced: 25K positive, 25K negative)
